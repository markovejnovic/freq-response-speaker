# freq-response-speaker

`freq-response-speaker` is a set of small `python` scripts which process input 
`.DAT` files to graph sinewaves and create Fourier transformations.

The main purpose of this project was to create a cohesive toolkit for 
processing audio waves, including Fourier transformations.

Yes, the name has nothing to do with it.

## Data processing

Every piece of data processing is done in `python`.

### Requirements

You need `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`.

### Getting started

To give the algorithm a spin, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:markovejnovic/freq-response-speaker.git
```
Next, add execution privileges to the script
```bash
cd Pickup-Position-Effects
chmod +x ./src/boiler.py
```

## Important note

I'm not quite sure how this works anymore or what it was supposed to do in the 
first place, but I got the code, so might as well put it up. Hope it helps you.
